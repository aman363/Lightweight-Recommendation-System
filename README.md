## Introduction
This repository contains the code and report for a lightweight recommendation system developed to provide personalized meal recommendations to users. The objective of this recommendation system is to offer tailored suggestions based on users' preferences and dietary requirements, while ensuring efficiency and accessibility through simplified algorithms and minimal computational resources. By leveraging content-based and user-based collaborative filtering techniques, the system generates practical and relevant recommendations to enhance the user experience in meal selection.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection: Gathered meal information from online sources using web scraping, including Healthline, NDTV Food, and Wikipedia.
2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Cleaned the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
3. Feature Engineering: Created new columns and encoded categorical variables for enhanced dataset representation.
4. Dataset Preparation: Selected relevant columns for recommendation generation.
5. Content-Based Filtering: Utilized features like nutrients and categories for personalized recommendations.
6. User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Calculated user similarity and recommended meals based on similar users' preferences.
7. Evaluation and Validation: Assessed the system's performance using evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion and Future Work
The lightweight recommendation system provides personalized meal recommendations based on user preferences and dietary requirements. Future enhancements can be made to improve the system's accuracy by refining recommendation algorithms and incorporating user feedback. Integration of additional data sources, such as user reviews and ingredient compatibility, can also enrich the recommendation process and provide more diverse suggestions to users.
